# SAAS Company Landing Page

This project is from the [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/?ref=traversy) challenge website and doesn't use any frameworks or libraries. It's built with pure HTML and CSS and a little bit of Javascript for the hamburger menu and the FAQ accordion.

I followed along with a tutorial from Traversy Media on YouTube.
